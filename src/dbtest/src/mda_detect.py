This function checks for cycles in a directed graph by performing topological sorting. It takes as input the directed edges (`edge`), 
in-degrees of nodes (`indegree`), and the total number of nodes in the graph (`total`).

Returns:
bool: True if a cycle is detected, False otherwise.

"""
Perform depth-first search (DFS) to find and print loops in a directed graph.

Args:
- result_folder (str): The path to the folder where the results will be saved.
- ts_now (str): The current timestamp or identifier for result file naming.
- now (int): The current node being visited.
- type (str): The type of edge leading to the current node ('C' for commit, 'R' for read, 'W' for write, etc.).

This function performs depth-first search (DFS) to find and print loops in a directed graph. It takes as input the result folder 
path (`result_folder`), the current timestamp or identifier for result file naming (`ts_now`), the current node being visited (`now`),
and the type of edge leading to the current node (`type`).

The function recursively explores the graph, tracking the visited nodes and edges to detect loops. When a loop is found, it is printed
to a result file in the specified result folder.

Note: This function assumes that global variables like 'visit', 'visit1', 'path', 'edge_type', and 'edge' are defined elsewhere.

Print the paths in a directed graph to a result file.

This function prints the paths in a directed graph to a result file. It takes as input the result folder path (`result_folder`),

The function iterates through the edges and writes the paths to the result file in the specified result folder.
